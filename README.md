### Road Rewards
> DISCLAIMER: No code is included in this repository.  This was my final project as a student in the Galvanize Web Development Immersive program, but also the beginning of product development in my role as CTO of Road Rewards LLC.  Since this is proprietary information, I made this repository which will explain the purpose of the app, give a screencast of the UX flow, include a link to my presentation of the app, and near the end of August contain a link to the Beta version of the Road Rewards app for download on the App Store.

### The Problem
#### Distracted Driving
* 9 people die from distracted driving every day
* Over 1000 injuries occur from distracted driving every day
* 1 in 4 accidents in the US is caused by distracted driving
> source: cdc.gov

### The Solution
> Road Rewards LLC offers an app which rewards drivers for staying off their phones.

#### How It Works
> The Road Rewards App, when active, enourages drivers to stay off their phones by rewarding them points based on how long the app is active on their phone while they are driving.  The points accrued can be redeemed at partner locations for discounts, gift certificates, and other rewards.
